# Users Info Decoding Task

I'd become a decoder for a couple of hours: </br>
Accepted a challenge (from a big cyber company) and created a python script which would extract users info from a coded `.txt` file (`ex_v7.txt`).

Instead of just printing the users dictionaries, the script creates another `.txt` file with the users decoded info (`users_info.txt`) ðŸ¤˜

## Running this thing
1. Clone the repo
2. Delete the `users_info.txt` file
3. Run `python decoder.py`
4. See the magic âœ¨

## Tech
* python
* regex
